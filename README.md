# ReadeStyleSnake

Okay, so this is my attempt at making snake, using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The thought is somewhat terrifying, as I have never worked with animation before, however it should be an ample opportunity to learn.

# Tests 

// Basic snake motion 
test.js - Let's try and get a div element moving left - Works as intended 30-05-16
test_1.js - Let's add a keypress and event listener for left. - Works as intended 30-05-16
test_2.js - Let's modularise the program (split eventListener and movement functions)  Works as intended 31-05-16
test_3.js - Add move right funcitonality - Works as intended 31-05-16

test_4.js - Reorganise code so that each keypress doesn't speed up the box


// Snake eating things
test2.js

// Random pelets appear. 




# Bugs

- The box shakes uncontrollably once moved.
- Each keypress makes the box speed up. 
- Create repository!
