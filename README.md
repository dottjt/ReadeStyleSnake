# ReadeStyleSnake

Okay, so this is my attempt at making snake, using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The thought is somewhat terrifying, as I have never worked with animation before, however it should be an ample opportunity to learn.

31-05-16 - Going well, but can't for the life of me get the direction movement working as I want. 

01-06-16 - rewritting it. messed it up.

02-06-16 - rewritting it AGAIN. Going to work on state logic, NOT ui logic. 

# Tests 

## snake grid/locate. 

FINAL test1.js - locate snake in two arrays. Works 02-06-16 Finally getting progress :)
		
## Basic snake motion 		

test2.js - move snake to the right. Works 02-06-16 // thank god! 
FINAL test2_1.js - move snake to the left, up AND down the "grid". Works 02-06-16 // Basically, all movement works. 

## Snake Keypress movement. 

test3.js - going to use just RightSnake and keypress to create movement. Works 02-06-16.

test3_1.js - going to make it work with left and right. Works 03-06-16 OMG ! Turns out that setInterval needs to be made global, otherwise it continues loop. 

test3_2.js - Going to make it work with up and down. Complete solution. Works 03-06-16. Spent like, eight hours working on this thing. Thank god!


## Snake eating things

test4.js - some random shit. 

Here's what I need to do:
+ create test html file for the 2 x 4 array. 
+ unit test specific function. 

test5.js - Okay, UI works properly. 




## Pellets appear randomly.
