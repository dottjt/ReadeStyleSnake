# ReadeStyleSnake

Okay, so this is my attempt at making snake, using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The thought is somewhat terrifying, as I have never worked with animation before, however it should be an ample opportunity to learn.

31-05-16 - Going well, but can't for the life of me get the direction movement working as I want. 



# Tests 



## Basic snake motion 




## Snake eating things
test2.js - When snake comes in contact with pellet 



## Random pelets appear.
