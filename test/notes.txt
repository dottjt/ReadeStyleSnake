test.js 

Okay, let's try again.
Snake will sit in an array. 
I can make it three arrays, or just one long one divided. 

so if array is 3 x 4; 

[0,0,0,0]
[0,0,0,0]
[0,0,0,0]

or 

[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

I think four arrays might be easier.


Okay, I think I might know my pain point. Working on too many different types of logic at once. Don't involve UI logic. Just focus on game logic FIRST. 



test3.js 

function snakeMovementEvent(event) {
	console.log(event.keyCode)
	if (event.keyCode === 115) {
		snakeMovementRight();
	} else if (event.keyCode === 97) {
		snakeMovementLeft();
	} else if (event.keyCode === 119) {
		snakeMovementUp();
	} else if (event.keyCode === 114) {
		snakeMovementDown();
	} else {
		return
	}
}


How do I stop setInterval? 

Maybe there's a way of simulating a keypress with setInterval? hmmmmm. Interesting. 


test3_2.js

My issue is moving up and down, setInterval doesn't change. Turns out the up/down variables were mixed up.
